r"""Regression tests for verify_solutions.py — the executable 已核验 gate.

Locks in the behaviour that matters: a WRONG recomputation fails (so a self-certified wrong
answer cannot ship as 已核验), a CORRECT one passes, an unbacked badge fails, and an honest
未自动核验 abstention is fine. Requires sympy (already a dependency of the skill).

Run:  python test_verify_solutions.py
